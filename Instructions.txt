This folder contains an environment that can be used for creating custom live coding questions on TypeScript for https://www.testdome.com
Before starting, make sure you have Node 14 installed.

Steps for creating a custom live coding question on TypeScript:
1. problem.ts should contain the template. (The candidate sees this in the coding box. It provides the starting code.)
2. tests.ts should contain test cases. (For each test case you want to test, provide one test method. Limits per test case: max memory is 256MB and max time is 3sec on 2GHz CPU.)
3. Open the command prompt, move to the folder that contains these files, and run the following command:
npm test
4. The template should fail for all test cases.
5. Replace the template with a solution, which should pass for all test cases.
6. You can add your custom question through the web interface: https://app.testdome.com/questions/edit/new?type=code&tab=summary
